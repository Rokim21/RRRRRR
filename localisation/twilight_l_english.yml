 twilight.1.d:0 ""Spike?"\n "Yeah, Twilight?"\n "Remember when you told me I could use my skills on the frontline?"\n There was a pause. "Yeah"\n "I've decided that you were right, and I can't stay here at the castle any longer."\n "Oh, um—"\n Not hearing Spike, Twilight continued. "I was scared of being responsible for so many ponies, but... the battle reports keep coming, and it's been over two years since the war started. Even if I'm scared to take command, if I help save more if I do than if I didn't, I guess it'll be worth it."\n "Yeah, the sum or whatever you call it."\n Twilight smiled. "Yes, the sum. And if you think about it, whenever we went on our adventures with our friends, we were always responsible for saving the entirety of Equestria anyway, and this is just more... obvious."\n There was a silence as the two thought of what to say. Then, Spike ran towards Twilight and hugged her. "Just stay safe okay, Twilight? When you get back with the others, we can have a simple picnic like old times."\n A tear ran down Twilight's cheek as she hugged him back. "Yes, Spike. We can have a picnic.""
